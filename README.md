ðŸŒ¾ Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages data analysis, feature engineering, and a Decision Tree Regressor to accurately predict crop yields based on environmental and agricultural parameters. By applying one-hot encoding, data normalization, and insightful exploratory data analysis (EDA), the model delivers high accuracy, with RÂ² scores exceeding 0.90 for most crops.

The repository includes:

Cleaned & encoded dataset for reproducibility

Model training & evaluation scripts

Visualizations showcasing yield trends by crop and country

Per-crop performance metrics for targeted analysis
